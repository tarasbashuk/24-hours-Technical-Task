# 24-hours Technical-Task

The is a simple web React app with the ability to search on YouTube, show the selected results on a (YouTube) player and save it as history into a database. It was done in 24 hours.
I intentionally use Redux in such a small app to show my understanding of this important library. Also, I use Mongoose to manage with MongoDB.
You have to 'run npm install' on both sides: server and client. Then run 'npm run dev', it concurrently starts both servers. 
For desktop screen only.
